You are looking at the top node of the Info tree documenting SML-MODE
(Version v4_0). Not all functions are documented here, but those that
aren't you probably won't miss. All commands and settable variables
have built-in documentation, as per usual Emacs conventions.

Introduction
************

SML mode is a major mode for Emacs for editing Standard ML. It has some
novel bugs, and some nice features:

   * Automatic indentation of sml code--a number of variables to
     customise the indentation.

   * Easy insertion for commonly used templates like let, local,
     signature, and structure declarations, with minibuffer prompting
     for types and expressions.

   * Magic pipe insertion: `|' automatically determines if it is used
     in a case or fun construct, and indents the next line as
     appropriate, inserting `=>' or the name of the function.

   * Inferior shell for running ML. There's no need to leave Emacs,
     just keep on editing while the compiler runs in another window.

   * Automatic "use file" in the inferior shell--you can send files,
     buffers, or regions of code to the ML subprocess.

   * Menus, and syntax and keyword highlighting supported for Emacs 19
     and derivatives.

   * Parsing errors from the inferior shell, and repositioning the
     source with next-error--just like in c-mode.

   * SML mode can be easily configured to work with a number of Standard
     ML compilers, and other SML based tools.

Contributors to the SML mode
============================

   Contributions to the package are welcome.  I have limited time to
work on this project, but I will gladly add any code that you
contribute to me to this package.

   Although the history of sml-mode is obscure, it seems that the
following persons have made contributions to sml-mode:

   * Lars Bo Nielsen wrote the original version of the code, providing
     the sml editing mode and the inferior-sml support.

   * Olin Shivers (`shivers@ai.mit.edu') hacked the inferior-sml support
     to use comint and call the whole thing ml-mode.

   * Steven Gilmore supposedly provided some early attempt at menubar
     support.

   * Matthew J. Morley (`matthew@verisity.com') was maintainer for a
     long time (until version 3.4) and provided many additions and
     fixes in all areas.

   * Frederick Knabe (`knabe@ecrc.de') provided the original code for
     font-lock and hilite support as well as for proper handling of
     nested comments and of all the string escape sequences.

   * Matthias Blume (`blume@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp') provided a sml-make
     which was replaced by sml-compile.

   * Monnier Stefan (`monnier@cs.yale.edu') completely reworked the
     indentation engine as well as most of the rest of the code and is
     the current maintainer since after version 3.4.

Getting started
===============

With luck your system administrator will have installed SML mode
somewhere convenient, so it will just magically all work--you can skip
the rest of this getting started section. Otherwise you will need to
tell Emacs where to find all the SML mode `.el' files, and when to use
them. The where is addressed by locating the Lisp code on your Emacs
Lisp load path--you may have to create a directory for this, say
`/home/mjm/elisp', and then insert the following lines in your
`/home/mjm/.emacs' file:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/home/mjm/elisp")
     (autoload 'sml-mode "sml-mode" "Major mode for editing SML." t)
     (autoload 'run-sml "sml-proc" "Run an inferior SML process." t)

The first line adjusts Emacs' internal search path so it can locate the
Lisp source you have copied to that directory; the second and third
lines tell Emacs to load the code automatically when it is needed. You
can then switch any Emacs buffer into SML mode by entering the command

     M-x sml-mode

It is usually more convenient to have Emacs automatically place the
buffer in SML mode whenever you visit a file containing ML programs.
The simplest way of achieving this is to put something like

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.\\(sml\\|sig\\)\\'" . sml-mode))

also in your `.emacs' file. Subsequently (after a restart), any files
with these extensions will be placed in SML mode buffers when you visit
them.

   You may want to pre-compile the `sml-*.el' files (`M-x
byte-compile-file') for greater speed--byte compiled code loads and
runs somewhat faster.

Help!
=====

You're reading it. Apart from the on-line info tree (`C-h i' is the
Emacs key to enter the `info' system--you should follow the brief
tutorial if this is unfamiliar), there are further details on specific
commands in their documentation strings. Only the most useful SML mode
commands are documented in the info tree: to find out more use Emacs'
help facilities.

   Briefly, to get help on a specific function use `C-h f' and enter
the command name. All (almost all, then) SML mode commands begin with
`sml-', so if you type this and press <TAB> (for completion) you will
get a list of all commands. Another way is to use `C-h a' and enter the
string `sml'. This is command apropos; it will list all commands with
that sub-string in their names, and any key binding they may have in
the current buffer. Command apropos gives a one-line synopsis of what
each command does.

   Some commands are also variables--such things are allowed in Lisp, if
not in ML! *Note Command Index::, for a list of (info) documented
functions. *Note Variable Index::, for a list of user settable variables
to control the behaviour of SML mode.

   Before accessing this information on-line from within Emacs you may
have to set the variable `sml-mode-info'. Put in your `.emacs' file
something like:

     (setq sml-mode-info "/home/mjm/info/sml-mode.info")

When different from the default this variable should be a string giving
the absolute name of the `.info' file. Then `C-c C-i' in SML mode
(i.e., the command `M-x sml-mode-info') will bring up the manual. This
help is also accessible from the menu. (Resetting this variable will
not be necessary if your site administrator has been kind enough to
install SML mode and its attendant documentation in the Emacs
hierarchy.)

Editing with SML Mode
*********************

Now SML mode provides just a few additional editing commands. Most of
the work has gone into implementing the indentation algorithm which, if
you think about it, has to be complicated for a language like ML. *Note
Indentation Defaults: SML Mode Defaults, for details on how to control
some of the behaviour of the indentation algorithm. Principal goodies
are the `electric pipe' feature, and the ability to insert common SML
forms (macros or templates).

* Menu:

* Basics::              On entering SML mode
* Indentation::         Prettying SML text
* Magic Insertion::     Templates and electric keys
* SML Mode Defaults::   Variables controlling indentation


File: sml-mode.info,  Node: Basics,  Next: Indentation,  Prev: SML Mode,  Up: SML Mode

On entering SML mode
====================

 - Command: sml-mode
     This switches a buffer into SML mode. This is a _major mode_ in
     Emacs. To get out of SML mode the buffer's major mode must be set
     to something else, like text-mode. *Note Getting Started::, for
     details on how to set this up automatically when visiting an SML
     file.

   Emacs is all hooks of course. A hook is a variable: if the variable
is non-nil it binds a list of Emacs Lisp functions to be run in some
order (usually left to right). You can customise SML mode with these
hooks:

 - Hook: sml-mode-hook
     Default: `nil'

     This is run every time a new SML mode buffer is created (or if you
     type `M-x sml-mode'). This is one place to put your preferred key
     bindings. *Note Configuration::, for some examples.


File: sml-mode.info,  Node: Indentation,  Next: Magic Insertion,  Prev: Basics,  Up: SML Mode

Automatic indentation
=====================

ML is a complicated language to parse, let alone compile. The
indentation algorithm is a little wooden (for some tastes), and the best
advice is not to fight it! There are several variables that can be
adjusted to control the indentation algorithm (*note Customising SML
Mode: SML Mode Defaults., below).

 - Command: indent-for-tab-command
     Key: <TAB>

     This command indents the current line. If you set the indentation
     of the previous line by hand, `indent-for-tab-command' will indent
     relative to this setting.

 - Command: indent-region
     Key: `C-M-\'

     Indent the current region. Be patient if the region is large (like
     the whole buffer).

 - Command: sml-back-to-outer-indent
     Key: `M-<TAB>'

     Unindents the line to the next outer level of indentation.

   Further indentation commands that Emacs provides (generically, for
all modes) that you may like to recall:

   - `M-x newline-and-indent'

     On <LFD> by default.  Insert a newline, then indent according to
     the major mode. *Note Indentation for Programs: (emacs)Program
     Indent, for details.

   - `M-x indent-rigidly'

     On `C-x <TAB>' by default.  Moves all lines in the region right by
     its argument (left, for negative arguments). *Note Indentation:
     (emacs)Indentation.

   - `M-x indent-for-comment'

     On `M-;' by default.  Indent this line's comment to comment
     column, or insert an empty comment. *Note Comment Commands:
     (emacs)Comment Commands.

   - `M-x indent-new-comment-line'

     On `M-<LFD>' by default.  Break line at point and indent,
     continuing comment if within one.  *Note Multi-Line Comments:
     (emacs)Multi-Line Comments.

   As with other language modes, `M-;' gives you a comment at the end
of the current line. The column where the comment starts is determined
by the variable `comment-column'--default is 40, but it can be changed
with `set-comment-column' (on `C-x ;' by default).

Electric features
=================

Electric keys are generally pretty irritating, so those provided by SML
mode are fairly muted. The only truly electric key is `;', and this has
to be enabled to take effect.

 - Command: sml-electric-pipe
     Key: `M-|'

     When the point is in a `case' statement this opens a new line,
     indents and inserts `| =>' leaving point just before the double
     arrow; if the enclosing construct is a `fun' declaration, the
     newline is indented and the function name copied at the
     appropriate column. Generally, try it whenever a `|' is
     wanted--you'll like it!

 - Command: sml-electric-space
     Key: `M-SPC'

     When the point is after a keyword like `let', this inserts the
     corresponding predefined skeleton if one exists.  Else it just
     inserts a space.  Another way to insert those skeletons is to use
     `sml-insert-form', described below.

 - Command: sml-electric-semi
     Key: `;'

     Just inserts a semi-colon, usually. The behaviour of this command
     is governed by the variable `sml-electric-semi-mode'.

 - Variable: sml-electric-semi-mode
     Default: `nil'

     If this variable is `nil', `sml-electric-semi' just inserts a
     semi-colon, otherwise it inserts a semi-colon and a newline, and
     indents the newline for SML.

 - Command: sml-insert-form
     Key: `C-c <RET>'

     Interactive short-cut to insert common ML forms (a.k.a. macros, or
     templates). Recognised forms are `let', `local', `case', `abstype',
     `datatype', `signature', `structure', and `functor'. Except for
     `let' and `local', these will prompt for appropriate parameters
     like functor name and signature, etc.. This command prompts in the
     mini-buffer, with completion.

     By default `C-c <RET>' will insert at point, with the indentation
     of the current column; if you give a prefix argument (i.e., `C-u
     C-c <RET>') the command will insert a newline first, indent, and
     then insert the template.

   `sml-insert-form' is also extensible: see *Note Configuration:: for
further details.


File: sml-mode.info,  Node: SML Mode Defaults,  Prev: Magic Insertion,  Up: SML Mode

Indentation defaults
====================

Several variables try to control the indentation algorithm and other
features of SML mode.  Most of them are still in flux so they are not
described here yet.  If the default values are not acceptable you can
set these variables permanently in your `.emacs' file. *Note
Configuration::, for details and examples.

 - Variable: sml-indent-level
     Default: `4'

     This variable controls the block indentation level.

Running ML under Emacs
**********************

The most useful feature of SML mode is that it provides a convenient
interface to the compiler. How serious users of ML put up with a
teletype interface to the compiler is beyond me... but perhaps there
are other interfaces to compilers that require one to part with serious
money. Such remarks can quickly become dated--in this case, let's hope
so!

   Anyway, SML mode provides an interaction mode, `inferior-sml-mode',
where the compiler runs in a separate buffer in a window or frame of
its own. You can use this buffer just like a terminal, but it's usually
more convenient to mark some text in the SML mode buffer and have Emacs
communicate with the sub-process. The features discussed below are
syntax-independent, so they should work with a wide range of ML-like
tools and compilers. *Note Process Defaults::, for some hints.

   `inferior-sml-mode' is a specialisation of the `comint' package that
comes with Emacs and XEmacs.

* Menu:

* Running ML::          Commands to run the ML compiler in a buffer
* ML Interaction::      Sending program fragments to the compiler
* Tracking Errors::     Finding reported syntax errors
* Process Defaults::    Setting defaults for process interaction


File: sml-mode.info,  Node: Running ML,  Next: ML Interaction,  Prev: Interaction Mode,  Up: Interaction Mode

Starting the compiler
=====================

Start your favourite ML compiler with the command

     M-x run-sml

This creates a process interaction buffer that inherits some key
bindings from SML mode and from `comint' (*note Shell Mode:
(emacs)Shell Mode.). Starting the ML compiler adds some functions to
SML mode buffers so that program text can be communicated between
editor and compiler (*note ML Interaction::).

   The name of the ML compiler is the first thing you should know how to
specify:

 - Variable: sml-program-name
     Default: `"sml"'

     The program to run as ML. You might need to specify the full path
     name of the program.

 - Variable: sml-default-arg
     Default: `""'

     Useful for Poly/ML users who may supply a database file, or others
     who have wrappers for setting various options around the command
     to run the compiler. Moscow ML people might set this to `"-P
     full"', etc..

   The variable `sml-program-name' is a string holding the name of the
program _as you would type it at the shell_. You can always choose a
program different to the default by invoking

     C-u M-x run-sml

With the prefix argument Emacs will prompt for the command name and any
command line arguments to pass to the compiler. Thereafter Emacs will
use this new name as the default, but for a permanent change you should
set this in your `.emacs' with, e.g.:

     (setq sml-program-name "nj-sml")

 - Command: run-sml
     Launches ML as an inferior process in another buffer; if an ML
     process already exists, just switch to the process buffer. A
     prefix argument allows you to edit the command line to specify the
     program, and any command line options.

 - Hook: inferior-sml-mode-hook
     Default: `nil'

     `M-x run-sml' runs `comint-mode-hook' and `inferior-sml-mode-hook'
     hooks in that order, but _after_ the compiler is started. Use
     `inferior-sml-mode-hook' to set any `comint' buffer-local
     configurations for SML mode you like.

 - Command: switch-to-sml
     Key: `C-c C-s'

     Switch from the SML buffer to the interaction buffer. By default
     point will be placed at the end of the process buffer, but a
     prefix argument will leave point wherever it was before. If you
     try `C-c C-s' before an ML process has been started, you'll just
     get an error message to the effect that there's no current process
     buffer.

 - Command: sml-cd
     When started, the ML compiler's default working directory is the
     current buffer's default directory. This command allows the working
     directory to be changed, if the compiler can do this. The variable
     `sml-cd-command' specifies the compiler command to invoke (*note
     Process Defaults::).


File: sml-mode.info,  Node: ML Interaction,  Next: Tracking Errors,  Prev: Running ML,  Up: Interaction Mode

Speaking to the compiler
========================

Several commands are defined for sending program fragments to the
running compiler. Each of the following commands takes a prefix argument
that will switch the input focus to the process buffer afterwards
(leaving point at the end of the buffer):

 - Command: sml-load-file
     Key: `C-c C-l'

     Send a `use file' command to the current ML process. The variable
     `sml-use-command' is used to define the correct template for the
     command to invoke (*note Process Defaults::). The default file is
     the file associated with the current buffer, or the last file
     loaded if you are in the interaction buffer.

 - Command: sml-send-region
     Key: `C-c C-r'

     Send the current region of text in the SML buffer.
     `sml-send-region-and-go' is a similar command for you to bind in
     SML mode if you wish: it'll send the region and then switch-to-sml.

 - Command: sml-send-buffer
     Key: `C-c C-b'

     Send the contents of the current buffer to ML.


File: sml-mode.info,  Node: Tracking Errors,  Next: Process Defaults,  Prev: ML Interaction,  Up: Interaction Mode

Finding errors
==============

SML mode provides one customisable function for locating the source
position of errors reported by the compiler. This should work whether
you type `use "puzzle.sml";' into the interaction buffer, or use one of
the mechanisms provided for sending programs directly to the
compiler--*note ML Interaction::.

 - Command: next-error
     Key: `C-x`'

     Jump to the source location of the next error reported by the
     compiler.  All the usual error-navigation commands are available,
     see *note Compilation Mode: (emacs)Compilation Mode..


File: sml-mode.info,  Node: Process Defaults,  Prev: Tracking Errors,  Up: Interaction Mode

Process defaults
================

The process interaction code is independent of the compiler used,
deliberately, so SML mode will work with a variety of ML compilers and
ML-based tools. There are therefore a number of variables that may need
to be set correctly before SML mode can speak to the compiler.  Things
are by default set up for Standard ML of New Jersey, but switching to a
new system is quite easy.

 - Variable: sml-use-command
     Default: `"use \"%s\""'

     Use file command template. Emacs will replace the `%s' with a file
     name. Note that Emacs requires double quote characters inside
     strings to be quoted with a backslash.

 - Variable: sml-cd-command
     Default: `"OS.FileSys.chDir \"%s\""'

     Compiler command to change the working directory. Not all ML
     systems support this feature (well, Edinburgh (core) ML didn't),
     but they should.

 - Variable: sml-prompt-regexp
     Default: `"^[-=>#] *"'

     Matches the ML compiler's prompt: `comint' uses this for various
     purposes.

   To customise error reportage for different ML compilers you need to
set two further variables before `next-error' can be useful:

 - Variable: sml-error-regexp-alist
     Alist that specifies how to match errors in compiler output.  Each
     elt has the form (REGEXP FILE-IDX LINE-IDX [COLUMN-IDX
     FILE-FORMAT...])  If REGEXP matches, the FILE-IDX'th subexpression
     gives the file name, and the LINE-IDX'th subexpression gives the
     line number.  If COLUMN-IDX is given, the COLUMN-IDX'th
     subexpression gives the column number on that line.  If any
     FILE-FORMAT is given, each is a format string to produce a file
     name to try; %s in the string is replaced by the text matching the
     FILE-IDX'th subexpression.

Configuration Summary
*********************

This (sort of pedagogic) section gives more information on how to
configure SML mode: menus, key bindings, hooks and highlighting are
discussed, along with a few other random topics.

* Menu:

* Hooks::               Creating them
* Key Bindings::        Binding commands to keys
* Highlighting::        Syntax colouring
* Advanced Topics::     You may need to speak Emacs Lisp


File: sml-mode.info,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Key Bindings,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Configuration

Hooks
=====

One way to set SML mode variables (*note Indentation Defaults: SML Mode
Defaults.), and other defaults, is through the `sml-mode-hook' in your
`.emacs'. A simple example:

     (defun my-sml-mode-hook () "Local defaults for SML mode"
       (setq sml-indent-level 2)        ; conserve on horizontal space
       (setq words-include-escape t)    ; \ loses word break status
       (setq indent-tabs-mode nil))     ; never ever indent with tabs
     (add-hook 'sml-mode-hook 'my-sml-mode-hook)

The body of `my-sml-mode-hook' is a sequence of assignments. In this
case it is not really necessary to set `sml-indent-level' in a hook
because this variable is global (most SML mode variables are). With
similar effect:

     (setq sml-indent-level 2)

anywhere in your `.emacs' file. The variable `indent-tabs-mode' is
automatically made local to the current buffer whenever it is set
explicitly, so it _must_ be set in a hook if you always want SML mode
to behave like this.

   Another hook is `inferior-sml-mode-hook'. This can be used to
control the behaviour of the interaction buffer through various
variables meaningful to `comint'-based packages:

     (defun my-inf-sml-mode-hook () "Local defaults for inferior SML mode"
       (add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions 'comint-truncate-buffer)
       (setq      comint-scroll-show-maximum-output t)
       (setq      comint-input-autoexpand nil))
     (add-hook 'inferior-sml-mode-hook 'my-inf-sml-mode-hook)

Again, the body is a sequence of assignments. Unless you run several ML
compilers simultaneously under one Emacs, this hook will normally only
get run once. You might want to look up the documentation (`C-h v' and
`C-h f') for these buffer-local `comint' things.


File: sml-mode.info,  Node: Key Bindings,  Next: Highlighting,  Prev: Hooks,  Up: Configuration

Key bindings
============

Customisation (in Emacs) usually entails putting favourite commands on
easily remembered keys. Two `keymaps' are defined in SML mode: one is
effective in program text buffers (`sml-mode-map') and the other is
effective in interaction buffers (`inferior-sml-mode-map').  The
initial design ensures that (many of) the default key bindings from the
former keymap will also be available in the latter (e.g., `C-c`').

   Type `C-h m' in an SML mode buffer to find the default key bindings
(and similarly in an ML interaction buffer), and use the hooks provided
to install your preferred key bindings. Given that the keymaps are
global (variables):

     (defun my-sml-mode-hook () "Global defaults for SML mode"
       (define-key sml-mode-map "\C-cd" 'sml-cd))
     (add-hook 'sml-mode-hook 'my-sml-mode-hook)

This has the effect of binding `sml-cd' to the key `C-c d'.  If you
want the same behaviour from `C-c d' in the ML buffer:

     (defun my-inf-sml-mode-hook () "Global defaults for inferior SML mode"
       (define-key inferior-sml-mode-map "\C-cd" 'sml-cd)
       ;; NB. for SML/NJ '96
       (setq sml-cd-command "OS.FileSys.chDir \"%s\""))
     (add-hook 'inferior-sml-mode-hook 'my-inf-sml-mode-hook)

   There is nothing to stop you rebuilding the entire keymap for SML
mode and the ML interaction buffer in your `.emacs' of course: SML mode
won't define `sml-mode-map' or `inferior-sml-mode-map' if you have
already done so.

Syntax colouring
================

Highlighting is very handy for picking out keywords in the program text,
spotting misspelled kewyords, and, if you have Emacs' `ps-print'
package installed (you usually do these days), obtaining pretty, even
colourful code listings--quite properly for your colourful ML programs.

   The indentation scheme (strangely enough) also relies on the
highlighting code to properly handle nested comments, which is yet
another reason to turn on highlighting.  To turn on highlighting, use
either of:

     M-x font-lock-mode
     (add-hook 'sml-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)
     (global-font-lock-mode 1)

   The first will turn it on in the current buffer.  The second will
turn it on in all sml-mode buffers.  The last will turn it on
everywhere.  This is valid for Emacs but maybe not for XEmacs.  Check
font-lock documentation if you encounter problems.

Advanced Topics
===============

           _These forms are bloody useless; can't we have better ones?_


You can indeed. `sml-insert-form' is extensible so all you need to do
is create the macros yourself. Define a _keybord macro_ (`C-x ('
<something> `C-x )') and give it a suitable name:
`sml-addto-forms-alist' prompts for a name, say `NAME', and binds the
macro `sml-form-NAME'. Thereafter `C-c <RET> NAME' will insert the
macro at point, and `C-u C-c <RET> NAME' will insert the macro after a
`newline-and-indent'. If you want to keep your macros from one editing
session to the next, go to your `.emacs' file and call
`insert-kbd-macro'; you'll need to add `NAME' to `sml-forms-alist'
permanently yourself:

     (defun my-sml-mode-hook () "Global defaults for SML mode"
       ;; whatever else you do
       (add-to-list 'sml-forms-alist '("NAME" . FUNCTION)))

   If you want to create templates like `case' that prompt for
parameters you'll have to do some Lisp programming. The `skeleton'
package is a good stating point.  Better yet, you can reuse the
wrappers used by sml-mode itself in your sml-mode-hook:

     (add-hook 'sml-mode-hook
       (lambda ()
         (sml-def-skeleton "case" "Case expr: "
           str " of" \n _ " => ")))

   This will redefine `case' in order to leave the `of' on the first
line.  See the documentation of `skeleton-insert' to get a better
understanding of how this works.


_I hate that indentation algorithm; can't I tweak it?_


Ah, yes, of course, but this manual will not tell you how.


_Can SML mode handle more than one compiler running at once?_

   Sure, just rename the `*sml*' buffer and then use `run-sml' as usual.


_What needs to be done to support other ML compilers?_


Not much really.  Just add the right regular expressions to
`sml-error-regexp-alist' and that should be all.
